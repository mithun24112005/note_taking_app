# Note Taking App

A simple, organized web application for creating, editing and managing notes.  
Designed to help you quickly jot down ideas, tasks, and longer form content — all in one place.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. User Input  
- The user opens the app and creates a new note or edits an existing one.  
- They type text (and optionally add formatting / tags) using the UI.  

### 2. Frontend & Storage  
- The frontend captures the user’s text and sends it (or directly saves it) to a local or remote store.  
- Notes are stored (for example) in a browser‐local database, file storage, or via an API call to a backend.  

### 3. Data Retrieval & Rendering  
- When the user opens or refreshes the app, all saved notes are retrieved and displayed in a list or grid.  
- Clicking/selecting a note opens it for edit/view mode.  

### 4. Note Management Features  
- Create new note → edit → save / autosave.  
- View list of notes with metadata (date created, tags, etc.).  
- Delete or archive notes.  
- (Optional) Search or filter notes by content or tag.  

### 5. Optional Enhancements  
Depending on your version, the app may also offer:  
- Tagging / categorisation of notes.  
- Markdown or rich-text formatting.  
- Offline support or persistent local storage.  
- Export/import of notes (e.g., Markdown, JSON).  
- Sync across devices (via backend or cloud).

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

| Component  | Role |
|------------|------|
| **UI / Frontend** | The interface for note creation, editing, listing and search |
| **Storage layer** | Holds the note data (local storage, database, backend API) |
| **Data retrieval / rendering** | Fetches and displays stored notes; handles update/delete logic |
